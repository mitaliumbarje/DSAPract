Algorithm:

Step 1: Input
Start
Read n (number of employees)
Read n salaries and store them into a list salaries

Selection Sort Algorithm
For each position i from 0 to n–1:
a. Assume min_pos = i
b. For each j from i+1 to n–1:
If salaries[j] < salaries[min_pos], update min_pos = j
c. Swap salaries[i] and salaries[min_pos]
Display the sorted list
Display top 5 highest salaries

Bubble Sort Algorithm
For each pass i from 0 to n–1:
a. Compare adjacent elements salaries[j] and salaries[j+1]
b. If salaries[j] > salaries[j+1], swap them
Display the sorted list
Display top 5 highest salaries
Step 10: Stop
